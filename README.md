# Workforce Management app- ProactiveWFM_app

You have been tasked to build a workforce managment app to help with schedling and human resource managment of Contact Centre. You have decided to make a WFM app to help with the rostering and scheduling for the contact centre.

You must be able to create new Employees ( which should include a team name, e.g. Thames, Start date, Contracted working hours, Shift patterns, Shift duration, Break times et.) which have an associated Employee Group (e.g. 'Call advisors', 'Supervisors'). Your app would then be able to track total shift hours per team, and display this in a view.

### MVP:

- Create new Employees,teams,shifts
- Display a list of all Employees,teams, shifts
- Display total contracted hours per Employee,team
- Display total Contracted and shift hours  by Employee Groups

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for the Employee records
- Show a warning when the shift hours for an employee is less that the contracted hours
- show Weekly employee shift patterns by team
- Any other ideas you might come up with
